Our First Model (Website Optimized): To track a user's hand movement, we used the TensorFlow js hand library. We also tracked the hand using a camera library. We created gesture functionality on our mock HTML webpages by using the different points associated with the user's hands. These gestures include using your hands to move the mouse and webpage, and in our example, we used gestures to like images on a social media platform.

Our Second Model (Optimized for Computer Systems): Python was used to create our second model. To access the camera on the hosting device, the Open-Cv python library was used. Our AI was able to detect hands thanks to the Python Mediapipe library. We were able to create an AI module that recognises hands, identifies the fingers up, and detects the distance between fingers using the Mediapipe Mediapipe library. We were able to train our AI to associate different hand gestures with different operations using these methods. To effectively demonstrate the experience provided by our AI, we developed a messaging app that is compatible with our model.

Desktop Application(Python): After you download the file, you need to install the dependencies. You can install the dependencies by running the following commands into your terminal.

pip install openCv

pip install Mediapipe

pip install autopy

pip install numpy

pip install pynput

After you install the dependencies, you run the main.py file, and give the application access to your camera.
